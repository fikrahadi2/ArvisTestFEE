### Cart Page

### Notes
- I add landing page, header (navbar), footer, and sidebar (responsive)
- For login page, i don't know how to use GET method, so it's only pages without function
- For navbar, i can't redirect url, i don't know why, usually i can but this time that can't direct normally
- For list page, button "Detail" can't direct too
- For detail page, button "Add to Cart" can't direct too, and i don't know how to use GET method, there's some error if i try
- For cart page, i don't know how to use multiplicate function in javascript, soo that total is not right
- I'm sorry, it's my first time build a website with React.js alone (usually with team and i can ask anything with them), and i don't know how to use database/local storage correctly, soo this is that i can do, i literally only proficiency at frontend that take care of UI/UX. If i be accepted by arvis, i hope i can get knowledge about all of my mistakes.
